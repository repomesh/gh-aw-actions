# setup_cache_memory_git.sh
# Pre-agent git setup for integrity-aware cache-memory.
#
# This script is run AFTER the cache is restored and BEFORE the agent executes.
# It ensures the cache directory contains a git repository with integrity branches
# and checks out the correct branch for the current run's integrity level.
# After git setup it applies pre-agent security sanitization: strips execute bits from
# all working-tree files, and removes files with disallowed extensions when
# GH_AW_ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS is set.
#
# Required environment variables:
#   GH_AW_CACHE_DIR:             Path to the cache-memory directory (e.g. /tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory)
#   GH_AW_MIN_INTEGRITY:         Integrity level for this run (merged|approved|unapproved|none)
#
# Optional environment variables:
#   GH_AW_ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS:    Colon-separated list of allowed file extensions for pre-agent
#                                sanitization (e.g. .json:.md:.txt). When set, any restored file
#                                whose extension is not in this list is removed before the agent runs.
